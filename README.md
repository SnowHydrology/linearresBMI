# snowBMI

**Description**:  This simple, temperature index snow model includes an implementation of the [Basic Model Interface](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/BMI) (BMI). It's meant for demonstration purposes, but feel free to use it however you like. I'd recommend it mostly for snow modeling, but you do you.

BMI is developed by the [CSDMS](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Main_Page) group at CU Boulder. Much of the BMI code here is from their [heat](https://github.com/csdms/bmi-example-python) example. 

## Dependencies

This is a simple bit of Python code developed with Python 3.9. The `snowBMI` module requires:

* The [BMI Python bindings](https://github.com/csdms/bmi-python) from CSDMS
* `numpy`
* `yaml`

The example also requires:

* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
* `pandas`
* `Matplotlib`

## Installation

First install the BMI Python bindings using the CSDMS instructions. Next, build the model by going to the main level of the `snowBMI` directory and running:

`pip install -e .`

## Usage

This model comes with an example Jupyter Notebook so you can see how the BMI functions work to control model execution and the handling of data.

## Known issues

This is but a simple model that makes several assumptions. They are:

* Snow hydrology is ignored (if melt is produced then it immediately disappears from the snowpack)
* Rainfall is added to snowmelt so that the melt term represents a land surface water flux
* The model is configured for a daily timestep
* Date handling is only done by a day of year tracker in the code (i.e., there is no explicit handling of POSIX-formatted datetimes)
